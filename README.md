# ByteCare Mobile

ByteCare was formed to counteract the problem of overcrowding in the waiting rooms of medical
 centres. This overcrowding, is a major factor when it comes to the spreading of illnesses and/or
  diseases and we hope to overcome the problem by providing a ticket management solution.
  
ByteCare is a ticket management that allows for the easy management of appointment at medical
 centres, thus reducing overcrowding in waiting rooms as well as reducing the chances of physical
  contact with sick indiciduals.
